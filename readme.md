# Garage hunter | multi-threaded spring boot web crawler

This project is a multi-threaded web crawler that collects information
about garage rents in budapest. It crawls the information from 
[ingatlan.com](http://ingatlan.com).I`ve used spring boot with gradle 
during the project. 

The app is multi-threaded and you can set the number of the threads in 
the `ThreadPool.java` file.
